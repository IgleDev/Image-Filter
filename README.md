# Image Filter
This is my project for class, it is based on the fact that you write a word in the input and it looks for the available images, until now it only filters by the following words:
- Messi
- Cristiano
- Canserbero
- Nirvana
- Montecastelo
- Ramon
- Eminem
- Over the garden wall.

I hope it helps you and any suggestion is always accepted. My gmail is: adriiglesias2016@gmail.com, My discord is: igle.exe#8778 and my Twitter is @igleepuntoexe. Thanks for read<3
